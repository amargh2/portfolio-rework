                This is a sample of some of the development projects I've made and deployed so far. Most of them are assignments from The Odin Project, 
                an open source course and community centered on learning the MERN stack from scratch. It's been and continues to be a fun journey of learning, 
                googling, and lots of reading and coding! While I am proud of my progress, 
                I am constantly humbled and excited by how much there is to find out, ways I can improve, and all that I don't know.
                I'm a big meditator and believer in beginner's mind, and I know from my time traveling that everyone has something to share and teach if 
                we know how to listen. I'm always trying to perfect that art. Which is my flowery way of saying I am open to constructive criticism and
                always looking for ways to be better, and I'd love to talk about it! ðŸ˜‰
